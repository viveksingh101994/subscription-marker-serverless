# Security & Access Management of API and data

## Current Implementation

Currently, the request will be validated in authorizor lambda on the basis of hardcoded header value
**Bearer 89abddfb-2cff-4fda-83e6-13221f0c3d4f**

## Future Implementation

- We can add JWT verification, which will validate the JWT and also can set the rules on the API for Access management
